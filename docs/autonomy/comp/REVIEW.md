# Composition lane — review queue

## Awaiting Matt

(run 10 in progress — phrase-quality fixes + Essen ingest; new items land
here as agents finish)

## Resolved

2026-07-30 (Matt, folded in run 10):
- Repeat/varytail phrases: "some progress, a few close to coherent;
  varytail is a BIG improvement in musicality." Complaints -> run-10
  fixes: phrase-length clamp too short (raise the TOP of the range, keep
  short end); short note durations should mean MORE notes, not
  ultra-short phrases (duration-aware sizing).
- Contrast-B A/B: contrast wins by a little; independent stays as an
  occasional option. Two rule gaps flagged and under mechanical
  investigation in run 10: (a) no final-note lengthening rule in this
  path (phrases ending in a flurry / long-then-short — "very unlikely in
  real music"); (b) figure joins never land on downbeats (everything
  reads as elision; alignment should be the default, elision occasional).
- Essen: cloned by Matt to corpus/essen-folksong-collection -> ingest
  running (run 10).


2026-07-30 (Matt verdict on old item #1, folded run 8):
- "Repeated figures repeat literally on the same tone; want repeat on different
  pitches / same-pitch-modified / both." -> ALREADY implemented run-7 as the
  three families in renders/markov_phrases2/ (transposed / varytail / combined);
  now mapped explicitly as review item #2 above, awaiting your ears. Old item #1
  (literal-repeat markov_phrases/ re-listen) is superseded by #2.
- New-goal fragments "New passage strategies" / "Figure transform operations"
  decomposed to backlog: passage strategies = #6 (re-raised); figure transforms =
  #10 (library landed run 8, wiring into phrase-builder queued).
- Volume note: taken. Run 8 ran 4 fronts (contrast-B, neural next-note,
  self-similarity screen, transform library).


2026-07-29 (Matt, run-5 folding):
- Parallel A/B: no single default — per-phrase choice (running pitch /
  explicit / parallel restart) stands as the complete mechanism menu.
- Scorer sanity: "second figure all one note" -> root-caused (range-guard
  selection bias) + fixed + monotony screens added to composite.
- Phase-2 phrases: "computer music; forget norm-breakers" -> outlier
  patterns dropped; re-listen queued post-fix.
- Essen license: cleared by Matt -> ingest queued (backlog 3c).
- Nottingham: cloned by Matt -> ingested (1024 tunes, folk bake-off run).
