# DSP lane — review queue

## Awaiting Matt

(run 9 in progress — new items land here as its agents finish: expand
round 3, formantseq round 2 @ higher weights, FM alias v2 C4-C8,
clarinet attack report, curve-dropdown fix check)

## Resolved

2026-07-30 (Matt, folded in run 9):
- v6 curves: all fine, taste-level — **lo adopted as default viola
  recipe** (patches/viola_default.json); tunable in UI Curves tab.
- FormantSequence round 1: "all nearly identical, subtle — FormantWeight
  too low?" — mechanically right: fmtWt 2 boosts in-band <=3x while the
  out-of-band partials dominate. Round 2 regenerating at w5/w9 + a
  flat-rolloff variant with formant-dominance verified in dB.
- Expand round 2 ranking (verbatim, reference):
  > fifth_r2 best — recursion adds pleasing bass "whoosh", even lusher
  > than r1, bump base partials to 10 next. leslie_swirl_combo best/most
  > subtle of the leslies (po softens) — try recurse 1 and 2. micro_r2 ==
  > leslie_micro_r2 (slot wasted, reuse). leslie_wide8 least subtle but
  > usable. wide2narrow: useful musical attack IF much faster — 0.02/
  > 0.05/0.08 s versions. fifth_leslie_morph: super cool sound effect —
  > quick-attack version + audio-rate morphing. pi_swept: even MORE
  > villain vibe. narrow2wide: very cool, special effect. semitone_r2 ~
  > r1, sound effect. breathe_lfos too in-your-face, sound effect only.
  > sweep_slow_ramp + phase_swirl least useful.
  All requested variants in run-9 batch (expand round 3).
- UI curve editor: good except vla_partials.bandwidth1 missing from the
  Add-curve dropdown (fix in progress, run 9); folder picker good;
  velocity bug unreproducible-and-gone.
- Second instrument: Bb clarinet chosen ("sounds wonderful"; trumpet
  samples disappointing — no attack character, skipped). Matt's
  observations logged: wind/brass attack speed & breath amount inversely
  proportional to frequency; these samples = gold standard for the
  breathy attack we've failed at repeatedly. My call per his question:
  ATTACK ANALYSIS FIRST (run-9 agent), then CMA-ES — a viola-shaped
  encoder won't invent breath structure, and run-7 already flagged
  scorer-vs-ear divergence on structural terms.
- FM alias A/B: inaudible as rendered — regenerating per his spec (5 Hz
  freq LFO to expose aliasing, notes C4-C8, os1 vs os8).

2026-07-29: curve editor requested->landed; CMA-ES "no worse" -> stage e
approved; expand round-1 categorization (see git history for verbatim).

2026-07-28: v5 grounded adopted; frequency-dependence principle; v4/UI
verdicts. 2026-07-27: v3 verdicts.
